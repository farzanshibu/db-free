// WHAT:  Every IPC command name, as one enum.
// WHY:   Exported to TS so `src/lib/ipc.ts` must declare a signature for each —
//        adding a command here without wiring it there is a TS compile error,
//        and the test below fails if it is not registered in lib.rs.
// HOW:   serde snake_case matches the `#[tauri::command]` function names.
// WHERE: src-tauri/src/lib.rs (generate_handler!), src/lib/ipc.ts (CommandMap)
