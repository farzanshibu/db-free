# DB Free

Lightweight, native database workbench. Rust core (Tauri v2, tokio, sqlx, rusqlite, scylla, neo4rs, rskafka, duckdb, rocksdb, reqwest) with a React/TypeScript UI.
Sub-second cold start, small memory footprint, no telemetry, works fully offline.

Each engine speaks its native language in the query tab (SQL, CQL, Cypher, AQL, SurrealQL, PromQL, SPARQL, XQuery, Query DSL, Redis commands…) and its collections / indexes / labels / topics / graphs / keys appear in the table browser.

**Features:** encrypted saved connections (AES-256-GCM, key in the OS keychain) · connection-string auto-detect ·
environment badges with read-only lock · virtualized table browser with sort, filter builder, pager and record inspector ·
inline editing with review-mode Pending Changes (visual diff + exact SQL, one transaction) or direct mode ·
SQL editor with schema-aware completion, format, explain plan, destructive-statement confirmation, history, saved queries and autosaved buffers ·
export/import (CSV, JSON, SQL dump) · ER diagrams from foreign keys · schema-diagram designer with DDL preview ·
dashboards (stat tiles, sparklines, line/bar/table widgets, variables, auto-refresh) · workflows (ordered SQL steps) ·
Redis key viewer · bring-your-own-key AI (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama) · command palette (⌘K) · settings.

## Develop

Requirements: Rust (stable), Node 20+, pnpm. On Linux also `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libdbus-1-dev`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Build installers

```sh
pnpm tauri build            # host platform: .dmg (macOS), .msi/.exe (Windows), .AppImage/.deb (Linux)
```

Pushing to `main` builds installers for all three platforms (macOS universal, Windows, Linux) and uploads them as workflow artifacts. Tagging `v*` attaches them to a draft GitHub release.

## Testing engines

`pnpm check` runs the guardrail, tsc, eslint, clippy and every unit + end-to-end
test. Adapter unit tests cover request/response shaping; the end-to-end suite
drives the real command path (connect → catalog → paged browse → filter → query,
plus the read-only lock and destructive confirmation) on the file engines.

Adapters also carry live round-trip tests gated on an environment variable, so
they are skipped unless a server is configured:

```
./scripts/live-tests.sh                 # every engine with a container image
./scripts/live-tests.sh qdrant neo4j    # just these
```

Each engine gets a throwaway container on a high port (5xxxx, so nothing
collides with your own stack) and is removed afterwards. Verified live so far:
memcached, meilisearch, typesense, qdrant, chroma, weaviate, elasticsearch,
couchdb, arangodb, surrealdb, orientdb, neo4j, cassandra, kafka/redpanda,
influxdb, prometheus, immudb, hbase, existdb, dynamodb (local), SPARQL (Fuseki),
duckdb, rocksdb, postgres, mysql, sqlite. Cloud-only engines (Snowflake,
BigQuery, Firestore, QLDB, Pinecone, Oracle) are unit-tested and carry live
tests that activate when you set their `DBFREE_TEST_*` variables.

## Quality gate

```sh
pnpm check                  # guardrail validator + tsc + eslint + clippy + cargo test
pnpm bindings               # regenerate TS types from Rust (#[ts(export)])
```
